# AI-Based Food Demand prediction System is about using artificial intelligence to guess how much food people will need in the future.
# This helps in: 
# (1)Avoiding waste: By predicting how much food is needed, we can avoid making or storing too much food, which might go bad.
# (2) Preventing Shortages: It ensures there's enough food available when and where people need it.
# (3) Better planning: It helps goverment agencies, shops, OR distributors Manage food supplies more efficiently.
# The project is about using AI to make food distribution smarter, saving time, money & resources, while ensuring no one runs out of food.
